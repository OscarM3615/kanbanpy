# kanbanpy

A console-based Kanban task manager created in Python.

Create and manage tasks visually in your terminal using simple commands.

## Features

- Simple CLI commands
- ASCII based kanban board
- Easy setup
- Stores tasks in a readable format (JSON).

## Installation

Install using pip running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
pip install kanbanpy
```

## Configuration

kanbanpy requires a config file located in the user's home directory. This file
can be generated using the `setup` command:

```sh
# Run the setup wizard
kanbanpy setup

# Or use the defaults
kanbanpy setup -y
```

## Usage

If you installed the library, you can use the CLI as a system command:

```sh
kanbanpy [...args]
```

Or call it as a Python import:

```sh
python -m kanbanpy [...args]
```

### Examples

Here are some examples of the commands available:

```sh
# Just display the kanban board
kanbanpy

# Create a new task
kanbanpy create "A new todo"

# Move task with id 1 to the next status
kanbanpy next 1

# Revert a task with id 1 to the previous status
kanbanpy prev 1

# Remove task with id 1
kanbanpy remove 1
```

Commands also have convenient aliases:

- `create`: `c`
- `next`: `n`
- `prev`: `p`
- `remove`: `r`

To explore the full list of commands, run:

```sh
kanbanpy --help
```

### Tips

#### Aliases

A handful technique is to define a shell alias to call the cli and take
advantage of the command aliases defined by the package.

```sh
# Instead of running:
kanbanpy create "my new todo"

# Define an alias in your .bashrc or .zshrc:
alias kb="kanbanpy"

# And type shorter commands:
kb c "my new todo"
```

#### Important tasks

Include a '!' in a task todo to mark it as important. The task will be
highlighted when displaying the board:

```sh
kanbanpy create "an important todo!"

kanbanpy create "project!: todo title"

kanbanpy create "(!) new todo"
```
